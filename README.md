## Introduction

Algorithmic trading involves using computer algorithms to automate the process of buying and selling financial instruments, such as stocks, currencies, or commodities. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in algorithmic trading by implementing and analyzing different trading strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Algorithmic-Trading-Project.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Algorithmic-Trading-Project`.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each trading strategy.
- `data/`: Sample financial data for testing the strategies.
- `src/`: Python source code for utility functions and strategy implementations.
- `results/`: Folder for storing backtest results and analysis.

## Trading Strategies

This project covers the implementation of various trading strategies:

1. **Building An Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund**: Implementation of an equal-weight portfolio strategy based on the S&P 500 index.

2. **Building A Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy**: Develop a momentum-based trading strategy to identify and trade trending stocks.

3. **Building A Quantitative Value Investing Strategy**: Creating a value-based trading strategy that identifies undervalued stocks.
